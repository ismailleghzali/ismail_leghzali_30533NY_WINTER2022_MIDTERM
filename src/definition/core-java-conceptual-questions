Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.
-A programming language is a language that programmers need to communicate with a computer.
So, from here we understand that it’s a computer language that helps developers to communicate
with a computer to create an application.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.
-JDK= Java Development Kit
-JRE: Java Runtime Environment
    =It’s a software that we need when we wants to create any application with java. It is for execution and development.
-JVM: Java Virtual Machine
    =Is a part of Java Runtime Environment.it is a kind of compilers that compile the file from .java to .class.
    the JVM understand what we write as human language and it convert it to the computer language
-JIT: Just In Time:
    =It’s an interpreter that is used to interpret the code from binaries to a native code. It’s a compiler.
-Debugger:
         =The debugger lets the user see how their program is viewed by the computer.
-Compiler:
         =It’s the responsible of translating the file from a .java file to a .class. in other words it converts
          the code from a human language to byte code.


What is IDE?
A.
-Integrated development environment. It’s a well-designed application that helps the programmers to write their
 codes by providing ready keywords and different colors,it also contains a compiler and a debugger

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.
.Eclipse
.IntelliJ IDEA
.MyEclipse
.NetBeans
.DrJava
.JDeveloper

Explain the entire java life cycle.
-The Java life cycle begin when the developers starts writing their source code in an IDE and this period we call
it text editing. Then after finishing the text editing we have to save the file under a .java extension.
in addition to that, after saving the file under an extension .java, the second step is the compilation step,
that it mean to convert the code from a human language to a computer language by using the command javac
(java compiler). Then we will get a .class file after the compilation.
Finally, the execution step, the application is ready for the execution after passing all the steps of code development
and the compilation.

what is class?
-A class is a blue print for creating objects. that means that any code that is written should be under a class otherwise
it's not going to be executed.

What is object?
-Is an instance of a class

What is the entry point of an application?
-the main method.

Why main is static?
- The main() method is static because its convenient for the JDK.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
- the object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
- the difference between path and classpath is the path is  set for java tools which is available in "bin" folder
 and it is used to compile the java program. while, the classpath is a set for java application to locate and
  compile java byte codes stored in the .class file. and it is used to load the .class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-the biggest difference between an Interface and Abstract class is the purpose. so, the abstract class is something
that you use when you want to generalize behavior. while, an interface is what you use when you want to standardize behavior.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
- NO. But we can implement a subclass of abstract class.Or a reference variable of an abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
- an access specifier or access modifier are  keywords like public, protected, default and private, used in java
to specify the scope of a variable or any class.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
- OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming,and it is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
OOP concepts include Class, Object, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
-class: A class is a blue print for creating objects. that means that any code that is written should be under a class otherwise
        it's not going to be executed.
-object: Is an instance of a class
-abstraction: in java is hiding the details and showing only the essential things.
-encapsulation: is a data hiding

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
- java package is the collection of Java classes and interfaces.
-java.lang Package is the package imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
- API= Application Programming Interface.is a collection of pre-written packages, classes, and interfaces with their
respective methods, fields and constructors.
-Rest-assured , Postman , JMeter, Katalon-Studio

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
- No, Multiple inheritance is not supported by Java.
-Java doesn’t allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it. One of the example of such problem is
the diamond problem that occurs in multiple inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
- it a method with same name but different parameters.
- it happens when we have two methods doing the same things. so, instead of defining the two methods we overload

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-exception in java is handling the runtime errors.
-we handle exceptions by Finally Block, or try and catch exception also throw and throws

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-The static keyword in Java is used for memory management. it belongs to the class than an instance of the class
-We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an
instance of the class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
-final is a  is a reserved keyword in java, and it has a different meaning depending upon whether it is applied to a
variable, class, or method.
- final keyword with a Variables means that the variable cannot be changed once initialized.
-final keyword with a method means that The method cannot be overridden by a subclass. Whenever we declare any method as
final, then it means that we can’t override that method.

What is final, finally and finalize?
-final is a  is a reserved keyword in java, and it has a different meaning depending upon whether it is applied to a
variable, class, or method.
- finally keyword comes with an exception handling to execute the code.
-finalize is an object garbage collection.


What is a constructor ?
-A constructor is a method that is called when an instance of the class is created. and it is used to initialize objects

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
-yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class, but the parameters should not be the same

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
- If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor,
called the default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
-This is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
-super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
-there are three ways to use the "super" keyword.it can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
it can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.In addition to that, it can be used to invoke immediate parent
class constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
-java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
- JVM is not platform independent because configuration of each OS differs.

What version of java are you using?
java 8
What is JAR stand for ?
- Java ARchive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
- the difference between JDK and JVM is JDK is the JDK is a kit that contains development tools that provide the
environment of programming a java program. on the other hand the JVM is an interpreter it is responsible of executing
the java program line by line.in addition to that, a JDK is platform dependent. while JVM is not platform independent.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
- the JRE contains the JVM, and the difference between them is the JRE run the java program while JVM execute or
interpret the java program

What is compile time and run time?
- the compile time is when we compile the file after writing the code by using the javac keyword from a .file
to a .class file. on the other hand the run time is we execute the code by using the java command to get the output
of the code.

What is heap?
-a heap is a memory management
-a heap is a chunk of memory that a program process can use to store data in some variable amount that won't
 be known until the program is running

How java manage it's memory?
-java manage it's memory by cleaning the unused space. so java uses an  an automatic memory management system called
 a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder is the Strings is an object used to represent a sequence
 of character.while, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes used for String manipulation.

What is Singleton class?
-it is a class that can have only one object

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
-Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.
 This mechanism is used to persist the object.

when to use transient variable in java?
****************************************************************
Difference between while and do..while loop?
- the difference is in while after testing the condition if it's true the statement will be executed. on the other hand,
do .. while means do the job first than print, that means it will show at least one statement even if the condition
is false.

What is Enum?
- an enum is a fixed set of constants

What is Iterator?
an Iterator is one of the three Java cursors. An Iterator is an interface that is used to fetch elements one by one in
 a collection

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- an integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
-The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization, caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-In Java, constructor chaining is a sequence of invoking constructors upon initializing an object.
constructor chaining is when we call a constructor from another constructor at the same class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-the difference between serial and parallel Garbage collector is the serial serial garbage collector runs on a single
thread and processes the heap in a single pass. While, the parallel garbage collector, on the other hand, runs on
multiple threads and processes the heap concurrently with the program's execution.

What is JIT stands for?
-just in time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
- the java heap space  is a region of memory where objects are created and stored, and it is managed by the JVM.On the
other side, Garbage collection is a system that automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used by a program.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
- the stack and the heap are two areas of memory, but the difference between them is the stack is a region of memory
that is used to store local variables and function call information. Yet, The heap is a region of memory that is used
to store objects.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
- a reflection is a feature that allows a program to examine and manipulate itself at runtime.
- it is useful because it enables the program to perform operations on objects whose type is not known at compile time.
it is also useful for debugging and testing purposes.

what is multithreading in java?
- Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. also, In the Java programming language
multithreading is implemented using the Thread class and its subclasses.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
- it;s the use of controlling the access to the shared resources by multiple threads.
it is used to protect the shared resources that are modified by multiple threads.

What is Framework?
- a framework is a platform with a ready codes that the developers use in java to write their codes easily. it can be
also a a collection of libraries and classes that provide a set of common functions and APIs that can be used to build
applications.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
-Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit, TestNG, Mockito...

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
-the main differences between the two frameworks consist on the philosophy of each one of them because the JUnit is
simple designed while the testNG designed to be more powerful and flexible.Secondly, the annotation, the two frameworks
use different sets of annotations to define test cases and control their execution. thirdly, the Execution model,
JUnit runs test cases in a specific order, while TestNG allows developers to specify the execution order of test cases
using dependencies and groups. finally, the Assertions,Both JUnit and TestNG provide a set of assertion methods that
can be used to verify the expected behavior of a test case. However, TestNG provides a more extensive set of assertion
methods and allows developers to define their own custom assertion methods.

What are the dependencies for this project?
-Maven, jUnit, mySQL
what is dependency injection in java?
- it is a design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies between objects.
-Dependency Injection is the ability of an object to supply dependencies of another object.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
-In Java, static binding refers to the process of binding method calls to the implementation of a method at compile time
- Dynamic binding, also known as late binding, refers to the process of binding method calls to the implementation of a
method at runtime.
