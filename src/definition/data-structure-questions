Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. we need it because it is very important because it helps us to organize and store data in way that is easy to use.
- we need it because it is an essential tool for organizing and manipulating data in a way that is efficient and effective.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
- Arrays, linked lists, Queues, hash tables, Heaps, sets. Maps

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
-Database systems, Operating systems, Computer networks, Compilers, Graphics and visualization,
 Artificial intelligence, Data mining..

what is an Array?
- an array is a tool that we use when we know the size of our data
it is used in java to store a collection of elements of the same data type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
- one of the most differences between the Array and ArrayList is the size, that means that the array size is fixed and
cannot be changed it has been created.while, the ArrayLists are dynamic, it can grow. in addition to that the array
can only store elements of a single data type. But the ArrayList can store elements of any data type and do not need
to be specified when the ArrayList is created.

what is LinkedList?
-linked list is a data is a kind of storage that store elements in a linear fashion, each element contains a link that
links between the next element in the list. the linked list works by the nodes to link  between the elements.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
the size of the array is a fixed and cannot be changed, and it comes in a linear data structure, also in terms
of element access the array elements can be accessed directly using their index, so the time complexity of accessing
an element in an array is constant. on the other hand, the size in the linked list is dynamic, that means that it can
grow. in addition to that, it comes in a format of nodes, each node stores a value and a reference (link) to the next
node. finally, the element access must be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of the list.

what is queue?
- a queue is a first in first out data structure
- a queue is a linear data structure that is open at both its ends

what is stack?
a stack is a data store that follows the structure of LIFO last in first out. the last element added should be removed
first

what is FIFO and LIFO?
-FIFO stands for first in first out. LIFO stands for last in first out. the two elements are methods for organizing and
managing data in a linear data structure, such as a stack or a queue.

what is the order of complexity?
-The order of complexity is a technique to describe a problem-solving approach based on the time and space the problem
needs.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The best case for searching an element from an array is when the element is found at the beginning of the array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
the worst case to search an element from an array is when the element is not present in the array, in addition to
 that if it is the last element in the array.

what is tree in data structure?
-a tree in data structure is a data structure that consists of nodes organized in a hierarchy.

what is graph in data structure?
-A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges
connecting these vertices. Graphs in data structures are used to address real-world problems.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
-the difference between the two classes HashMap and Hashtable is the HashMap is not synchronized and Hashtable is
synchronized and this makes the HashMap faster than Hashtable but not safe. on the other hand, HashMap allows null
keys and null values, while Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. In addition to that, HashMap is part of
the Java Collection Framework, while Hashtable is a legacy class.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-In RDBMS the major data structures used are tables, rows, and columns.
-In a Network data model, the major data structure is the graph.
-In a Hierarchical data model, the major data structure is the tree

How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
